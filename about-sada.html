  <h1>About SADA</h1>
  <p>
    SADA COIN is the native utility token powering the BridgeX protocol — a decentralized bridge that enables fast, secure, and trustless interoperability between the Solana and Cardano blockchains.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed to solve the lack of cross-chain infrastructure between these two major networks, SADA COIN is used for transaction fees, staking, governance, and incentivizing participants within the BridgeX ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    With its advanced architecture leveraging Solana smart contracts and Cardano's Plutus scripts, BridgeX facilitates seamless token transfers, cross-chain dApp development, and decentralized applications that span both ecosystems.
  </p>
  <p>
    SADA COIN represents the backbone of this vision — a truly interoperable future for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and beyond.
